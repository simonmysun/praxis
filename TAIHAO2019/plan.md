## Problems

### Poker
This is a mathematical problem. I chose the problem by these conditions:
* Should be easy to validate
* Should be inspiring
* Should lead to much mathematical knowledge during the exploration of solution
* Should not be too easy or too hard for a level of a non-mathematics bachelor student

There wasn't too many options. A lot of interesting problems were opted out for not satisfying one or more conditions. This one was found in Matrix67's blog.

The problem is about group theory. The shuffling procedure is a permutation $\sigma$. We know $\sigma^2=\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}
  A & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & J & Q & K \\
  10 & 9 & Q & 8 & K & 3 & 4 & A & 5 & J & 6 & 2 & 7
\end{smallmatrix}\bigr)$, and it cannot be decomposed into disjoint cycles. Thus, $\sigma$ also cannot be decomposed into disjoint cycles, which means, $\sigma^{13}=\mathrm{id}$, $\left(\sigma^2\right)^7=\sigma$. Then we know $\sigma=\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}
  A & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & J & Q & K \\
  9 & A & 4 & Q & J & 7 & 3 & 2 & 10 & 5 & K & 8 & 6
\end{smallmatrix}\bigr)$

To avoid computation you can write the permutation in the form of matrix $M$ and calculate $\left(M^2\right)^2\cdot M^2 \cdot M)$, which requires $4$ matrix multiplication instead of $7$.

Answer: 9,A,4,Q,J,7,3,2,10,5,K,8,6
Key: 21161

### Multiplication
Match correct multiplication statements in the domain ^x+\*x+=x+$ using only the ECMAScript subset of regex functionality.

This problem is chosen because regex is within the boundary. The problem itself, as far as I could see, was firstly proposed by Davidebyzero.

During my search I realized that there are far more things regex can do than I ever thought:
* https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/126373/am-i-a-fibonacci-number (I would use this if it is not so hard)
* https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/3503/hard-code-golf-regex-for-divisibility-by-7 (This is left as an exercise of Regex Golf Triple problem)
* https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/36384/find-the-smoothest-number/178889#178889
* https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/121731/is-this-number-a-factorial#178979
* https://github.com/Davidebyzero/RegexGolf/blob/master/regex%20for%20matching%20OEIS%20A033286.txt

And in later levels of Regex Golf, there are quine regex or regex validating addition(numbers themselves rather than their length), etc. I haven't solved them yet by now, and haven't got any answer from the internet either.

Solutions to be done.
