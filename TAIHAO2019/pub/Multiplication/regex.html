    <p>It's not easy. It is recommended to solve all of the "Classic" set and "Teukon" set in the <a href="https://alf.nu/RegexGolf">Regex Golf website</a> first. They are more friendly.

    <p>I couldn't find a good instruction for regex (especially ECMAScript subset) but <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp">here</a>'s one that include everything you will need. And <a href="http://deerchao.net/tutorials/regex/regex.htm">here</a>'s a thorough introduction in Chinese, which I think is very good. It took me about 30 minutes to learn regex every time I need to use it. </p>

    <p>The author got distracted by this while preparing his 78th <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/78/">'What if?' post</a> (which was published one day after this comic). </p>
    <p>I wish you could master this powerful and effective tool and make full use of it in the future. </p>
