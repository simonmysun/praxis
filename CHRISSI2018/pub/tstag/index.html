    <p>I was going to write a real world problem at the beginning. There would be riddles guiding people to different places to discover what's next. However, I found out that I couldn't make it interesting enough. And hardly anything can be learned from its solution. So I finally decided to make it very simple. Reaching the problem here became the riddle itself. </p>
    <p>How about looking around? </p>
