## Problems

### Sagittarius

I rendered the sky and hid the flag message at the direction of Sagittarius. In December Sagittarius cannot be seen at night, and in the day time the message is hidden by the sunshine.

Solution: You have to adjust your time to see the flag.

### Robot Karol

I wrote a programm printing birthday greetings in Robot Karol 2.3. However it cannot run because of some mistakes and the limitation of Robot Karol software.

Solution: Fix the bugs and run the programm in parts separately. Or you may also understand the program and interpret the it your self.

### Draw Tudou

It was a program based on Google's Quickdraw data set. Due to the limitation of my laptop. Only selected data were trained. I intended to make a interesting story like _Dictionary of the Khazars_ and hide the flag under a specific entry, which can be accessed by drawing in the frame. However, I wasn't able to make up such a story, and the time was very limited. Besides, The lack of training led to significant inaccuracy and destroyed all the joy of solving it. It was a failure.

Solution: Draw a dog.

### Crypto

In order to allow more time for debugging and optimizing the other problems, This problems was intended to cost more time. However it was a easy one.

Solution: Braille's direction suggests that the text should be read after some rotation. And the hint in the Morse code tells that it was bacon ciphered(even when you search bacon code you get bacon cipher). After deciphering you get the message.

### Injection

I wrote this smart assistant to demonstrate my understandings on injections. Try to hack it.

Solution: The clerk read the form strictly and wait for response after a punctuation '.', which allows an injection. Construct a request that ends the previous request and start a new request. It will be read out by the clerk so the smart assistant will trust and execute it.

### Real Life

The original problem was abandoned. You only have to find the problem itself.

Solution: Observe each problem's url, and you will find out they composite a sentence and lack the final part.
